            <h1>Grid Based Layout</h1>
            <p>Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank">eleken.co</a></p>

            <h2>The Cove</h2>
            <p><i>SETH ROSENBLOOM</i></p>
            <p>I’m resting on a tide-bleached tree, and you<br>are looking for stones. Like we’ve always done,<br>from back when our son was little. But now,<br>it’s up to us to fill in the bucket. Stones lapped<br>smooth by the force of the moon. Pigmented<br>in colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiters<br>with ghostly rings. You’re too far away to hear,<br>and there is no pain, so I won’t make a fuss. It’s just<br>thumps in my throat. My pulse runs up numbers<br>on the screen of my watch, even as I sit here, still.<br>My mind re-walks the trail through the forest<br>to where the headlands open. Down the switchback.<br>Past fallen old growths, their upended roots spider<br>towards the sky. We’re the only ones who hiked here<br>today. Even if there were cell coverage, how many hours<br>before help arrives? So, breathe, bear down on the abdomen<br>like the cardiologist said. Listen to the wind rush<br>into this mouth of salinity. This cove, embraced by hills<br>that shoulder hemlocks. Lava born from the mantel,<br>cooled into outcrops, carved to pool star fish and purple<br>anemones. Home of endless give and take.</p>
